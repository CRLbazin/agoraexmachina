AgoraExMachina - Platform of liquid democracy
==========================================================

General presentation
------------------------
**AGORA EX MACHINA** (AEM) is a liquid democracy web platform running under PHP/MySQL initially inspired by the German solution Adhocracy.

Liquid democracy is a democratic principle in which a `participatory democracy` is implemented by a part of `representative democracy`: each vote can be delegated to another person whose expertise is considered. In a web platform, the mechanisms that allow and facilitate the expression of the `Vote` and its `Delegation` are fluidified, facilitated and made faster.

Presentation of the platform
-----------------------------
The **AEM** platform allows you to create `Workshops` which are organized by `Theme` (Category). Any member registered for the workshop can participate in `Discussions` (Forums) and `Vote` on `Proposals` . They may also choose to "Delegate" their vote to another person of their choice registered in the "Workshop". 

The `Workshops' are designed so that the discussion and voting phases can be dissociated: thus, a group of voters can first discuss a specific topic and then vote on it. Once the workshop is over, the votes are collected and calculations of participation in the vote, acceptance of the vote with regard to the *quorum*, etc. are presented to the public. The proposals with the most votes (whether positive, negative or neutral) are validated at the end of the workshop.

The `Votes` concern a simple Yes, No or Abstention choice among a set of proposals.
